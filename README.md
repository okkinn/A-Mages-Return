A Mage's Return is a Java-based shooter game developed using the JavaFX library as a mini-project for CMSC 22. It was developed to practice the design and application of OOP concepts-Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism-in a working project.

## Game Description

Embark on a magical journey in "A Mage's Return," an shooter action game that follows the story of a mage transported to an unfamiliar world riddled with various enemies. The mage's ultimate goal is to amass enough magical energy in order to cast a powerful portal spell to return to his home world.
